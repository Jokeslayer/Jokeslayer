Even when I was a child, I could see the obvious impact that advancing technology was making on the world I was making my way through. I wanted to be a part of that. To me, coding and software development is my path to building wonders, and accomplishing things that others thought were impossible. I want to use the unique perspective that I possess, as a person on the Autism spectrum, to find new and innovative solutions to old problems. Iâ€™ve seen what technology has done over the past 30 years. I want to be a part of what it does in the next 30.

# Projects


## [Friedclay.com](https://github.com/Patgoral/Fried-Clay-Client)

### Mongoose/Express/React/Node 

An adventure race leaderboard app.  This allows users to submit their results, as well as upload a photo and a GPX file.  This creates a live updated leaderboard, where you can click each name and see their results, image, and the GPX track rendered to a map.  This was a huge challenge as far as managing the massive amount of data associated with GPX files.  Most of this was handled on the backend, with multiple parsing functions, and a conversion to encoded polyline before sending to the server.  I published my solution for parsing the data and converting it to encoded polyline as a NodeJs package.  This can be found at: [gpx-to-encoded-polyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpx-to-encoded-polyline)
