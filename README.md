Even when I was a child, I could see the obvious impact that advancing technology was making on the world I was making my way through. I wanted to be a part of that. To me, coding and software development is my path to building wonders, and accomplishing things that others thought were impossible. I want to use the unique perspective that I possess, as a person on the Autism spectrum, to find new and innovative solutions to old problems. Iâ€™ve seen what technology has done over the past 30 years. I want to be a part of what it does in the next 30.
